# Report, explaining why Basic Auth is weak and suggesting stronger alternatives (JWT, OAuth2).

## Why Basic Authentication is Weak
We implemented **Basic Authentication** to secure our API endpoints. However, we identified several weaknesses with this method:

- **No Encryption:** Credentials are only Base64-encoded, not encrypted. If intercepted, they can be easily decoded.
- **No Session Management:** Each request must include the credentials, which can be inefficient and insecure.
- **Vulnerable to Replay Attacks:** If an attacker intercepts the credentials, they can reuse them indefinitely.

## Stronger Alternatives
To address these weaknesses, we suggest the following stronger alternatives:

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Tokens are signed and can include expiration times, making them more secure and scalable for modern applications.
- **OAuth2:** Provides authorization frameworks for third-party applications, supporting token expiration, refresh tokens, and scopes for fine-grained access control.
