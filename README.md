## Project Description
In this group project, we are creating an enterprise level fullstack application to process MoMo SMS data in XML format, clean and categorize the data, store it in a relational database, and provide a frontend for analysis and visualization.

# Repository Structure
 



# System Architecture

Our architecture is based on an **ETL pipeline + database + frontend dashboard**, with an optional API layer.  

   ðŸ”¹ Flow
1. **Input Layer**
   - Receives XML data (MoMo SMS).
   - Handles initial input and validation.

2. **ETL Pipeline**
   - Parse: To extract transaction records from XML.
   - Clean: Normalize dates, amounts, and phone numbers.
   - Categorize: Classify transactions (deposit, withdrawal, transfer).
   - Load: Insert cleaned and categorized data into SQLite.

3. **Database Layer**
   - Stores normalized and categorized transactions in SQLite.
   - Provides structured queries for analytics.

4. **Frontend Dashboard**
   - Reads processed JSON/DB data.
   - Visualizes transactions using charts and tables.

5. **Optional FastAPI Backend**
   - Provides API endpoints 
   - Serves data to frontend or external systems
